## 🚀 Next Steps (YOUR ACTION ITEMS)

### 1. IMMEDIATE (Today - 30 minutes)

```powershell
# Step 1: Run environment setup
.\scripts\setup_environment.ps1

# Step 2: Verify everything works
python scripts\check_system.py

# Step 3: Prepare initial dataset
python scripts\prepare_dataset.py
```

### 2. CRITICAL (Today - 1 hour)

**Edit `dataset/metadata.csv` with accurate Hungarian transcriptions**

This is THE MOST IMPORTANT step for quality!

Current file has placeholder text like:

```
1_vago_finetune2|Üdvözlöm önöket a kvízműsorban!|istvan_vago
```

You MUST replace with accurate word-for-word transcriptions of what István Vágó says in each audio file.

Tips:

- Listen to each clip carefully
- Type exactly what you hear
- Use proper Hungarian diacritics
- Include punctuation for natural prosody
- Have a native speaker verify if possible

### 3. START TRAINING (Tonight - 6-8 hours)

```powershell
# This will run overnight
python scripts\train_xtts.py

# Monitor in another terminal:
tensorboard --logdir run\training
```

### 4. EVALUATE (Tomorrow)

```powershell
# Generate samples
python scripts\inference.py

# Listen and assess quality
# Check: run/training/[run_name]/test_audios/
```

### 5. ITERATE (This week)

Based on results:

- Collect more István Vágó audio (critical if quality is low)
- Adjust hyperparameters
- Refine transcriptions
- Retrain until quality is acceptable

## 📊 Current Dataset Status

| Metric         | Current     | Recommended | Status   |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Audio Files    | 13 clips    | 20-50 clips | ⚠️ Low   |
| Total Duration | ~1.7 min    | 15-30 min   | ⚠️ Low   |
| Sample Rate    | 22050 Hz    | 22050 Hz    | ✅ Good  |
| Audio Quality  | TBD         | >20 dB SNR  | 🔄 Check |
| Transcriptions | Placeholder | Accurate    | ⚠️ TODO  |

**Priority**: Get more István Vágó audio! This is critical for quality.

Potential sources:

- YouTube clips of his quiz shows
- TV archives
- Interviews
- Public appearances

Target: 20-30 minutes of diverse, clean audio

## 🎓 What You'll Learn

This project covers:

- ✅ Advanced TTS model fine-tuning
- ✅ Audio signal processing
- ✅ Deep learning training optimization
- ✅ Hungarian language NLP
- ✅ GPU-accelerated computing
- ✅ Production ML pipeline design

## 💡 Key Insights & Design Decisions

### Why XTTS-v2?

- Open source (no API costs)
- Multi-lingual by design (excellent Hungarian support)
- Can achieve commercial quality with proper tuning
- Fast inference (<500ms)
- Full control over model and data

### Why These Hyperparameters?

```python
BATCH_SIZE = 2              # RTX 4070 sweet spot (12GB VRAM)
GRAD_ACUMM_STEPS = 126      # Effective batch = 252 (paper recommendation)
LEARNING_RATE = 5e-6        # Conservative for quality
NUM_EPOCHS = 25             # Typical for fine-tuning
TEMPERATURE = 0.75          # Balanced (consistency + expressiveness)
```

### Why This Audio Processing Pipeline?

1. **Noise reduction** - Clean training data = better quality
2. **Silence trimming** - Focus on speech, reduce wasted computation
3. **RMS normalization** - Consistent volume across clips
4. **Peak limiting** - Prevent clipping/distortion
