ISTVÁN VÁGÓ VOICE CLONE - QUICK ACTION MENU
================================================================================

Your Current Status:
   Dataset: 80 samples, properly classified into 7 categories
   Model: Trained for 30 epochs (5.22 GB)
   Quality: Good text understanding, moderate audio quality
   Samples: 24 test files generated (v1 + v2)

================================================================================
OPTION 1: CONTINUE TRAINING (RECOMMENDED) 
================================================================================
Best for: Quick improvement without starting over

Command:
  python scripts\continue_training.py

What it does:
   Trains 20 more epochs (3050 total)
   Improves audio smoothness
   Reduces overfitting
   Time: ~17 minutes

Expected improvement:
   Training loss: 2.15  1.5-1.8 (better quality)
   Smoother, more natural speech
   Better prosody consistency

================================================================================
OPTION 2: RETRAIN WITH NEW CLASSIFICATION 
================================================================================
Best for: Starting fresh with improved dataset

Commands:
  # Delete old training
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "run\training_milliomos\XTTS_*"
  
  # Start new training
  python scripts\train_xtts_milliomos.py

What it does:
   Trains from scratch with reclassified data
   Better category-specific prosody
   Time: ~26-35 minutes

Use this if:
   You want to test impact of new classification
   Current model has fundamental issues
   You have time for full training

================================================================================
OPTION 3: GENERATE MORE TEST SAMPLES 
================================================================================
Best for: Evaluating current model quality

Commands:
  # Generate with default params
  python scripts\generate_samples.py
  
  # Generate with improved params (lower temp)
  python scripts\regenerate_improved.py

What it does:
   Creates test samples for all categories
   Helps you decide if more training needed
   Time: 2-5 minutes per run

Check for:
   Voice similarity to István Vágó
   Natural Hungarian pronunciation
   Proper quiz show energy
   Smooth vs choppy delivery

================================================================================
OPTION 4: EXPAND DATASET 
================================================================================
Best for: Achieving professional quality

Current: 80 samples (14.8 min)
Target: 150-200 samples (30+ min)

Weak categories:
   Confirmation: only 2 samples 
   Excitement: only 7 samples
   Greeting: only 6 samples

If you have more audio:
  python scripts\analyze_and_segment.py

Benefits:
   Much better voice consistency
   More natural prosody
   Less overfitting
   Professional quality results

================================================================================
OPTION 5: DEPLOY FOR PRODUCTION 
================================================================================
Best for: If satisfied with current results

Integration options:
   REST API (Flask/FastAPI)
   Desktop app (PyQt/Tkinter)
   Batch processing
   Discord/Telegram bot

Model location:
  run/training_milliomos/XTTS_20251002_2323-.../best_model.pth

================================================================================
MY RECOMMENDATION: START HERE 
================================================================================

Step 1: Listen to your samples (5 minutes)
  Location: test_outputs/ and test_outputs_v2/
  Question: Are they good enough for your use case?

Step 2a: If satisfied  Deploy (Option 5)
Step 2b: If needs minor improvement  Continue training (Option 1)
Step 2c: If needs major improvement  Expand dataset (Option 4)

Step 3: Generate fresh samples and re-evaluate

================================================================================
QUICK START: Most Common Path
================================================================================

# 1. Continue training to improve quality
python scripts\continue_training.py

# 2. Generate new test samples
python scripts\generate_samples.py

# 3. Listen and compare
# Compare: test_outputs_v3/ vs test_outputs_v2/

# 4. Decide: Good enough? Deploy! Not enough? Repeat or expand dataset.
