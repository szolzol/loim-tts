# Next Steps - How to Move Forward

**Current Status:** October 3, 2025

- ‚úÖ Dataset properly classified (80 samples, 7 categories)
- ‚úÖ Model trained (30 epochs, 810 steps, 5.22 GB)
- ‚úÖ Initial samples generated (12 test samples)
- ‚úÖ Semantic reclassification complete (44 files moved)

---

## Option 1: Continue Training (RECOMMENDED) üéØ

Your current model shows good progress but has room for improvement:

- **Training loss:** 2.15 (good)
- **Eval loss:** 5.07 (moderate - indicates some overfitting)
- **Recommendation:** Train 20-50 more epochs

### How to Continue Training:

```powershell
# Start training from the last checkpoint
cd F:\CODE\tts-2
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'
python scripts\train_xtts_milliomos.py
```

**Expected improvement:**

- Better audio quality (lower mel loss)
- More natural prosody
- Reduced overfitting with more iterations

**Time:** ~17-45 minutes (20-50 epochs)

---

## Option 2: Retrain from Scratch with New Classification üîÑ

Since you've improved the dataset classification, you might want to start fresh:

### Benefits:

- Model learns proper emotional categories
- Better category-specific prosody
- More accurate voice matching per category

### Steps:

1. **Delete old training run:**

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "run\training_milliomos\XTTS_*"
```

2. **Start fresh training:**

```powershell
cd F:\CODE\tts-2
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'
python scripts\train_xtts_milliomos.py
```

**Time:** ~26-35 minutes (30-40 epochs recommended)

---

## Option 3: Test Current Model More Thoroughly üéß

Before more training, evaluate what you have:

### Generate more diverse samples:

```powershell
# Generate samples with original parameters
python scripts\generate_samples.py

# Generate with improved parameters
python scripts\regenerate_improved.py
```

### Create custom test phrases:

Edit `scripts/generate_samples.py` to add your own Hungarian quiz phrases:

```python
TEST_PHRASES = [
    ("question", "Your custom question here?", "question_001.wav"),
    ("excitement", "Your custom excitement!", "excitement_001.wav"),
    # ... add more
]
```

### Listen and evaluate:

- Voice similarity (0-10): How close to Istv√°n V√°g√≥?
- Emotional accuracy: Does excitement sound excited?
- Pronunciation: Clear Hungarian pronunciation?
- Smoothness: Natural flow vs choppy?
- Quiz show energy: Proper TV presenter tone?

---

## Option 4: Expand Dataset üìä

Your 80 samples (14.8 min) is on the lower end. More data = better results.

### Target: 30+ minutes (150-200 samples)

**Where to get more:**

1. Extract more clips from the same Milliomos episode
2. Use additional episodes if available
3. Focus on underrepresented categories:
   - Confirmation: only 2 samples ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Excitement: only 7 samples
   - Greeting: only 6 samples

### How to extract more:

```powershell
# If you have more audio files in new_source/
python scripts\analyze_and_segment.py
```

**Time to prepare:** 1-2 hours
**Training time:** ~40-60 minutes (with more data)

---

## Option 5: Production Deployment üöÄ

If you're satisfied with current results, deploy the model:

### Create inference script:

```python
# scripts/production_inference.py
from TTS.tts.configs.xtts_config import XttsConfig
from TTS.tts.models.xtts import Xtts
import torch

MODEL_DIR = "run/training_milliomos/XTTS_20251002_2323-October-02-2025_11+23PM-06571a9"

def load_model():
    config = XttsConfig()
    config.load_json(f"{MODEL_DIR}/config.json")

    model = Xtts.init_from_config(config)
    model.load_checkpoint(config, checkpoint_dir=MODEL_DIR, eval=True)

    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        model.cuda()

    return model

def generate_speech(text, reference_audio, output_file):
    model = load_model()

    gpt_cond_latent, speaker_embedding = model.get_conditioning_latents(
        audio_path=[reference_audio]
    )

    out = model.inference(
        text=text,
        language="hu",
        gpt_cond_latent=gpt_cond_latent,
        speaker_embedding=speaker_embedding,
        temperature=0.65,
        top_p=0.90,
        top_k=40,
    )

    # Save output...
```

### Integration options:

- REST API using Flask/FastAPI
- Desktop app with PyQt/Tkinter
- Batch processing script
- Discord/Telegram bot

## My Recommendation: üéØ

Based on your results, I suggest this sequence:

### Phase 1: Evaluate Current Model (30 minutes)

1. ‚úÖ Listen to all 24 generated samples (v1 + v2)
2. ‚úÖ Rate voice quality (1-10)
3. ‚úÖ Note specific issues (emphasis, pronunciation, etc.)

### Phase 2: Quick Refinement (1 hour)

1. üîÑ **Continue training 20 more epochs** from checkpoint
   - This often smooths out remaining issues
   - Quick improvement without starting over
2. üéß Generate new samples
3. üìä Compare improvement

### Phase 3: Decision Point

- **If satisfied:** Deploy! (Option 5)
- **If needs more work:** Expand dataset + retrain (Options 2+4)
- **If specific issues:** Fine-tune generation parameters

## Quick Start Commands

### Continue Training (Recommended First Step):

```powershell
cd F:\CODE\tts-2
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'
python scripts\train_xtts_milliomos.py
```

### Generate Fresh Test Samples:

```powershell
python scripts\generate_samples.py
python scripts\regenerate_improved.py
```

### Check Training Progress:

```powershell
Get-Content "run\training_milliomos\XTTS_*\trainer_0_log.txt" -Tail 50
```

---

## Expected Results After 20 More Epochs:

- **Training loss:** 2.15 ‚Üí ~1.5-1.8 (30% improvement)
- **Audio quality:** Smoother, more natural
- **Overfitting:** Reduced gap between training and eval
- **Voice consistency:** More reliable Istv√°n V√°g√≥ character

---

## Questions to Consider:

1. **Are the v2 samples better than v1?** (lower temp, better params)
2. **Which categories sound best?** Focus more training on weak ones
3. **Is 80 samples enough?** Or should you extract more?
4. **What's your use case?** Quiz show app? Narration? Memes?

## Need Help Deciding?

Tell me:

- How do the generated samples sound? (good/bad/mixed)
- What's your goal? (production app, testing, personal project)
- How much time can you invest? (quick results vs. perfect quality)

I'll give you a specific action plan based on your answers!
