# Continue Fine-Tuning with Blikk Interview Data

## 🎯 Objective

Expand and improve István Vágó voice model by adding 231 new samples from a Blikk interview, continuing from the best Milliomos model.

---

## 📊 Combined Dataset Summary

### Dataset Composition:

```
Milliomos (Quiz Show):    80 samples, 14.8 minutes
Blikk (Interview):       231 samples, 24.9 minutes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                   311 samples, 39.7 minutes ✅
```

### Category Breakdown:

- **Long** (7-10 sec): 110 samples from Blikk
- **Medium** (4-7 sec): 67 samples from Blikk
- **Short** (2-4 sec): 54 samples from Blikk
- **Question**: 1 sample from Blikk
- **Plus**: All 7 original Milliomos categories (80 samples)

### Quality Rating: 🟢 **EXCELLENT**

- Duration > 30 minutes ✅
- Multiple speaking styles (quiz show + interview) ✅
- Varied emotional content ✅
- Professional recording quality ✅

---

## 🔄 Training Strategy

### Approach: **Continued Fine-Tuning**

- Start from: Best Milliomos model (30 epochs, 2.15 loss)
- Train for: 30 additional epochs
- Learning rate: 2e-6 (reduced for fine-tuning)
- Batch size: 3 (same as before)

### Why This Works:

1. **Preserves existing learning**: Keeps the quiz show voice quality
2. **Adds new capabilities**: Learns interview conversational style
3. **Increases robustness**: More diverse training data reduces overfitting
4. **Better generalization**: Can handle both quiz show and natural conversation

---

## 📈 Expected Improvements

### From Current Model (Milliomos only):

- **Text loss**: 0.0267 → ~0.020 (better text understanding)
- **Mel loss**: 2.13 → ~1.5-1.8 (smoother audio)
- **Eval loss**: 5.07 → ~3.0-4.0 (reduced overfitting)

### Voice Quality:

- ✅ More natural prosody (interview data is conversational)
- ✅ Better handling of varied sentence lengths
- ✅ More consistent voice character
- ✅ Reduced choppiness
- ✅ Better emotional range

### Robustness:

- ✅ Works on both quiz show and conversational text
- ✅ Less sensitive to input text style
- ✅ Better pronunciation consistency
- ✅ More natural pauses and pacing

## ⚙️ Training Configuration

```python
Dataset:       dataset_combined/ (311 samples, 39.7 min)
Starting from: run/training_milliomos/XTTS_*/best_model.pth
Output:        run/training_combined/XTTS_Combined_*/
Epochs:        30 (additional)
Batch size:    3
Learning rate: 2e-6 (reduced for fine-tuning)
Language:      Hungarian (hu)
Eval split:    2% (~6 samples)
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Batch File (Easiest)

```cmd
TRAIN_COMBINED.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps

```powershell
# Step 1: Prepare dataset (already done!)
python scripts\prepare_blikk_dataset.py

# Step 2: Start training
python scripts\train_combined.py
```

---

## ⏱️ Time Estimates

- **Dataset Preparation**: ✅ Complete (2 minutes)
- **Training Time**: ~30-40 minutes
  - 311 samples / batch size 3 = ~104 steps per epoch
  - 30 epochs × 104 steps = ~3,120 steps
  - ~0.7 seconds per step = ~36 minutes

---

## 📊 Monitoring Progress

### During Training:

Watch for these metrics in the terminal:

```
Step X/3120:
  loss_text_ce: Should decrease below 0.020
  loss_mel_ce:  Should decrease to 1.5-1.8
  loss:         Should decrease to 1.5-2.0
```

### Evaluation (every 100 steps):

```
Evaluation:
  loss_text_ce: Should be ~0.015-0.025 (excellent)
  loss_mel_ce:  Should be ~2.5-3.5 (good, less overfitting)
  loss:         Should be ~2.5-3.5
```

### Good Signs:

- ✅ Training loss steadily decreasing
- ✅ Eval loss not too far from training loss (less overfitting)
- ✅ Text CE loss very low (<0.03)
- ✅ No loss divergence or NaN values

### Warning Signs:

- ⚠️ Loss stops decreasing (may need more epochs)
- ⚠️ Eval loss much higher than training (still some overfitting, but OK)
- ❌ Loss increases or becomes NaN (stop and investigate)

## 🎧 After Training

### Generate Test Samples:

```powershell
# Update generate_samples.py to use new model
# Then run:
python scripts\generate_samples.py
```

### Compare Results:

1. **Milliomos model** (30 epochs, quiz show only)
2. **Combined model** (30+30 epochs, quiz + interview)

### What to Listen For:

- Voice consistency (should sound like same person)
- Smoothness (less choppy than before)
- Emotional accuracy (matches intended tone)
- Natural pauses (better pacing)
- Quiz show energy vs conversational tone

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Why Continue from Checkpoint?

- **Preserves knowledge**: Model already knows István Vágó's voice
- **Faster convergence**: Starts from good baseline
- **Better quality**: Incremental improvement vs starting over
- **Efficiency**: Saves 30 epochs worth of training time

### Why Lower Learning Rate?

- **Fine-tuning**: Don't want to "forget" quiz show voice
- **Stability**: Prevents catastrophic forgetting
- **Precision**: Makes smaller, more careful adjustments
- **Balance**: Learns new data while keeping old knowledge

### Dataset Quality:

- **Blikk interview**: More conversational, varied pacing
- **Milliomos quiz**: High energy, structured format
- **Together**: Best of both worlds

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After training, the model should:

✅ **Voice Similarity**: 8-10/10 (sounds like István Vágó)
✅ **Quiz Show Energy**: Preserved from original training
✅ **Conversational Tone**: Added from interview data
✅ **Smoothness**: 8-10/10 (natural flow, no choppiness)
✅ **Pronunciation**: 9-10/10 (perfect Hungarian)
✅ **Versatility**: Works on varied text styles

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If training fails:

1. Check disk space (needs ~10 GB)
2. Check GPU memory (RTX 4070 should be fine)
3. Verify dataset_combined/ exists
4. Verify previous model exists

### If quality is poor:

1. Train 20 more epochs (total 50+30=80)
2. Generate with different temperatures (0.55-0.75)
3. Use better reference audios
4. Check for any corrupted audio files

### If voice changes too much:

- Learning rate too high (reduce to 1e-6)
- Too many epochs on new data
- Need to re-balance dataset
